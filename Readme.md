# How to make BarSubItem behave like BarCheckItem


<p>Imagine that you have a BarSubItem. For instance, this submenu contains some BarCheckItem items. If any of these items are checked within the submenu, it would be useful to make a BarSubItem have a checked state as well.  Thus, the BarSubItem can reflect whether or not any of  its child items are checked. </p><p>This example demonstrates how to implement this facility.  Please refer to the <a href="https://www.devexpress.com/Support/Center/p/KA18594">How to make BarSubItem behave like BarCheckItem</a> article for more information on how to introduce this functionality.</p><br />
